          </div>
          Have you ever had to move to another city on your own without any acquaintanes, or without any possible current vacancy, regardless of the reason?

          Well even if you have not, we assume that you have at one point in your life encountered what it feels like to have roommates. Depending on how much you have experienced or heard, one could assume that you have encountered the feelings of displeaure & other negative emotions, or thoughts such as „this person is nothing like person Y (in a negative way)“, „I wish I had another roommate, somebody more...“. Or perhaps you have been stood up by a roommate who had bailed out on the deal way sooner than agreed upon?
          <p><img src="images/photo-about.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="150" class="project-img_1" />Well we aim to remove these scenarios from your life, of at least reduce them by a possible significant amount</p>
          <br />
          <h2>Our Goals</h2>
          <p>With the RMA we aim to introduce you to a platform where you can search for the people that you do want to be share living space with. Here you will be able to present your qualities and flaws in a binary way, also displaying your other traits as detailed descriptions, which is the same for other users. Then you and many more people will be able to search for the things they like and avoid the things they dislike. Afterwards when you have found or have been found by a potential roommate and have „matched“ with that person, a chat option will be available for your to engage in a non-binary discussion for your future plans of sharing living space.</p>
